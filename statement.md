**Project Title:** Multi-purpose Program

**● Problem Statement**

When doing everyday calculations, whether it's basic arithmetic,
checking an area for some basic shaps, or quickly solving a quadratic
equation, people usually jump b/w different apps, websites, or physical
calculators. Switching between tools every time becomes inconvenient and
breaks focus, especially for students or anyone trying to finish work
quickly.

The idea behind this project is to bring all these frequently used
functions into one simple and approachable program, so users don't have
to rely on multiple tools for small tasks.

**● Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project is to develop a **Multi-purpose application**.

**What the program can do:**

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) , uses decimal library to
  avoid floating point issues. It can handle errors like dividing by 0.

- 2D Geometry calculations (can find area and perimeter for square,
  rectangle, triangle, circle).

- 3D Geometry calculations (calculates surface area and volume for cube,
  cuboid, sphere, cylinder).

- Algebraic tool for finding the roots of a standard quadratic equation
  (\$ax\^2 + bx + c = 0\$). Can even find imaginary(complex) roots using
  cmath module.

- A basic stopwatch (uses time library)

- Input checking to avoid errors like division by zero and negative
  lengths for shapes.

**What is out of scope of this program:**

- Advanced scientific functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms,
  matrix).

- Graph making capabilities.

- Saving user Data or user accounts.

- Unit conversions (e.g., meters to feet).

**● Target Users**

The application is made for anyone person that requires to do quick
calculations or, use diverse mathematicsal tools:

1.  **Students (Middle School to College):** students may need this for
    school/college assignments

2.  **People doing home projects or DIY:** people who could need fast
    and simple area/volume calculator

3.  **General Users:** Anyone who is needing a simple and reliable
    arithmetic calculator and few tools like a stopwatch for any specfic
    tasks

**● High-Level Features**

The application will feature a clear and simple menu where you can
accesss simple features like:

**Feature 1: Basic Arithmetic Calculator**

- Supports basic four functions (+, -, \*, /).

- Handles errors like 0 division

**Feature2: 2D Geometry Calculator**

- **Square:** Calculates area and perimeter from side length.

- **Rectangle:** Calculates area and perimeter from length and width.

- **Triangle:** It can find perimeter and area using either Heron\'s
  formula (for 3 sides) or right angled triangle (for if you have only
  base and height of right angled triangle).

- **Circle:** Finds area and circumference just from radius.

**Feature 3: 3D Geometry Calculator**

- **Cube:** Calculates surface area and volume just from 1 side length.

- **Cuboid:** Calculates surface area and volume from length, width, and
  height.

- **Sphere:** Calculates surface area and volume jusr from radius.

- **Cylinder:** can find surface area and volume from radius and height.

**Feature 4: Quadratic Equation Solver**

- Accepts coefficients \$a\$, \$b\$, and \$c\$ for the equaton \$ax\^2 +
  bx + c = 0\$.

- Calculates and givess the real or complex roots based on the
  discriminant (\$D = b\^2 - 4ac\$).

**Feature 5 :Stopwatch Utility**

- Simple stopwatch activated and stopped by user input (by pressing
  Enter).

- Displays time in seconds.
